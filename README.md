### Business
Help a user undestand a product, its value and capabilities

### Product
Collect data at the beginning so a user can use all product features

### Engineering
1. Create a system where you can easily add new steps that explain some part of the product without changing logic
2. Save a step where a user stoped if the process has been interupted
3. Be able to go to a previous step 
4. Be able to skip a step
5. Generate needed steps based on empty data

At that point we didn't want multiple devices support, so we used localstorage. It was migrated to db in 7 months
